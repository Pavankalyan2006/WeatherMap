Of course. Here is a complete README.md file content for your GitHub repository. This file explains what the project is, what technologies it uses, and how to set it up and run it.

Just copy the text below and paste it into a file named README.md in your project's root directory.

Weather-Aware Navigation App üå¶Ô∏è
This is a full-stack web application that provides a comprehensive, multi-stop route planning and navigation experience with a unique focus on real-time weather integration. The app is designed to help drivers on long journeys anticipate weather conditions along their path, enhancing safety and planning.

The application fetches the optimal driving route from the Google Maps API, samples points along the path, and retrieves live weather data for each point from the OpenWeatherMap API. It then transitions into a live navigation assistant, using the device's GPS to provide turn-by-turn guidance.

Key Features
Multi-Stop Route Planning: Plan a trip with a start, a destination, and multiple intermediate waypoints.

Live Weather Overlays: See real-time weather icons (temperature, conditions, wind) at ~50 km intervals directly on the map.

Real-time Traffic: The map displays Google's live traffic data to help visualize congestion.

Turn-by-Turn Navigation: Once a route is planned, the app uses your device's GPS to track your progress, highlight your current step in the directions list, and display the next maneuver.

Interactive UI: A responsive sidebar displays a route summary, detailed weather reports on click, a full list of directions, and live navigation updates.

4. API Key Configuration
This project requires three API keys to function.

Google Maps (x2): You need two separate keys from the Google Cloud Console.

Frontend Key: Restricted by Website (http://127.0.0.1:5000/*). Must have Maps JavaScript API & Places API enabled.

Backend Key: Restricted by IP Address (127.0.0.1). Must have Directions API & Places API enabled.

OpenWeatherMap (x1): Get a free API key from OpenWeatherMap.

Create a file named .env in the root of the project directory and add your keys like this:

# .env

# For the browser (restricted by Website URL)
GOOGLE_FRONTEND_KEY=paste-your-frontend-key-here

# For the Python server (restricted by IP Address)
GOOGLE_BACKEND_KEY=paste-your-backend-key-here

# For weather data
OWM_KEY=paste-your-openweathermap-key-here
5. Run the Application
Start the Flask development server:

Bash

python server.py
Open your web browser and navigate to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000

Usage
Enter a starting location and a destination.

Click the + Add Stop button to add any intermediate waypoints.

Click Get Route & Weather to see the path, traffic, and weather icons on the map, along with a full directions list in the sidebar.

Click Start Navigation to begin live GPS tracking. The map will follow your location, and the sidebar will update with your next maneuver and highlight your current step.
